 <a class="title"> Abstract:</a>  
<a class='body'> Party branding research is generally concerned with how voters form partisan identities. In legislative research, concerns about the party brand are deemed to be central to understanding legislative organization and behavior. Yet different theories make different assumptions about branding objectives. We shed light on this debate by investigating one visible event - the 2013 government shutdown. Rather than committing to a single branding objective, party leaders employed different means to advance multiple objectives. Faced with choosing between supporting the strong partisans who favored a shutdown, and the moderates who opposed one, Republican leaders tried to appease
both by moving forward with the shutdown and then emphasizing the party's unwavering efforts to end it in their public communications. Rank and file members supported their leaders' messaging efforts, but were also more likely to go "off message" if they
represented more conservative constituencies.</a></p>

<a class="title"> Abstract:</a><a class='body'>  In May 2011, thousands of outraged citizens (i.e. the <i>indignados</i>) occupied the squares of the main Spanish cities to express their discontent and claim for reforms. This article investigates via Twitter messages the ability of the 15-M movement to place their claims into the media agenda and to keep ownership of their own discourse. The analysis emphasizes the fact that the social movement originated in the Internet with a highly decentralized structure and with scarce organizational resources. Results show that protesters discourse included a great number of claims, although the activists focused their discussions on three specific issues: electoral and party systems, democracy and governance, and finally, civil liberties. Moreover, the study reveals that the <i>indignados</i> managed to keep control over their repertoires and were able to determine the media agenda despite the later mainly focused on the most dramatic events.</a> </p>

<a class='body'>[<i>To be presented at the 2015 APSA meeting, San Francisco 3-6 September.</i>]</a> 
<br>
<a href="casas_morar_APSA15.pdf">Draft, August 2015</a> <a class="title">

 <a class="title"> Abstract:</a>  
<a class='body'>Political scientists frequently study the public communications of members of Congress to better understand their electoral strategies, policy responsiveness, ability to influence public opinion and media coverage of Congress. However, different studies base their conclusions on different communication channels, including (among others) member websites, newsletters, press releases, and social media. All these scholars have taken these individual sources as fully representative of the communication strategy of the elected official as a whole. However, what has not been asked is whether members communicate the same or different messages across these differing channels? In this paper we look at the member press releases, Twitter, and Facebook messages sent from August to December 2014 in order to study to what extent their communication strategy is consistent across channels. We use an automatic semi-supervised method to classify the messages into political issues and to assess the validity of inferring broader communication patterns from a single source. Do members tend to highlight the same or different issues, and attempt to appeal to the same or different audiences across the different communications channels? Does message consistency vary or over time or context such as district competitiveness? Through this work we aim to give an empirical grounding to the implied notion that studying one communication channel is a proxy for studying all communication channels.</a><br><br>
