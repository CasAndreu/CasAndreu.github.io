<a class="title"> Abstract:</a><a class='body'>  In May 2011, thousands of outraged citizens (i.e. the <i>indignados</i>) occupied the squares of the main Spanish cities to express their discontent and claim for reforms. This article investigates via Twitter messages the ability of the 15-M movement to place their claims into the media agenda and to keep ownership of their own discourse. The analysis emphasizes the fact that the social movement originated in the Internet with a highly decentralized structure and with scarce organizational resources. Results show that protesters discourse included a great number of claims, although the activists focused their discussions on three specific issues: electoral and party systems, democracy and governance, and finally, civil liberties. Moreover, the study reveals that the <i>indignados</i> managed to keep control over their repertoires and were able to determine the media agenda despite the later mainly focused on the most dramatic events.</a> </p>

Policy Position and Legislative Performance Branding during the 2013 Government Shutdown <a class='body'> (with </a> <a href= "https://faculty.washington.edu/jwilker/Bio.pdf"> John Wilkerson</a> <a class='body'>)</a> </a><br>

 <a class="title"> Abstract:</a>  
<a class='body'> A large research literature portrays party labels as marketing brands that serve as efficient sources of information about a party's candidates. Parties build strong brands by sending clear and consistent signals to voters. But how do party leaders promote strong brands that benefit all party members? The answer is not always obvious. In 2013, House Republican leaders initiated a partial government shutdown under pressure from conservatives, even as others in the caucus warned that it might cause Republicans to lose the House. We find that, after initiating the shutdown, party leaders engaged in a public messaging effort that downplayed the divisive issues leading to the shutdown (position branding) and emphasized the party's progress in resolving it (legislative performance branding). These findings provide insights into how party leaders seek to address internal branding conflicts, and may help to explain why the shutdown did not end up being the electoral disaster many predicted. </a></p>

 <a class="title"> Abstract:</a>  
<a class='body'> Do images shared online increase rates of protest mobilization? If so, how? In this paper we study the spread of Twitter support for Black Lives Matter and for Shutdown April 14, a specific Black Lives Matter protest, from April 13 to April 20, 2015. As predicted by the literature on images and social movements, we find that, all else equal, an increase in the percentage of tweets with images contributes to an increase in subsequent tweets about the movement. Similarly, an increase in the percentage of tweets with images contributes to a increase in the number of new users tweeting about the protest. We then consider which types of images contribute most to increases in online protest support. This allows us to adjudicate between theories that claim different mechanisms for why new imaging technology should facilitate political mobilization. Images might a) act as an emotional trigger; b) reduce information costs; c) increase expectations of success; or d) generate collective identity. Our paper thus provides empirical evidence supporting the broad argument that image-sharing increases the likelihood of a protest to diffuse while also teasing out the narrow mechanisms at play in a new media environment. </a></p>

<a class='body'>[<i>To be presented at the 2015 APSA meeting, San Francisco 3-6 September.</i>]</a> 
<br>
<a href="casas_morar_APSA15.pdf">Draft, August 2015</a> <a class="title"> 
<br>
 <a class="title"> Abstract:</a>  
<a class='body'>Political scientists frequently study the public communications of members of Congress to better understand their electoral strategies, policy responsiveness, ability to influence public opinion and media coverage of Congress. However, different studies base their conclusions on different communication channels, including (among others) member websites, newsletters, press releases, and social media. All these scholars have taken these individual sources as fully representative of the communication strategy of the elected official as a whole. However, what has not been asked is whether members communicate the same or different messages across these differing channels? In this paper we look at the member press releases, Twitter, and Facebook messages sent from August to December 2014 in order to study to what extent their communication strategy is consistent across channels. We use an automatic semi-supervised method to classify the messages into political issues and to assess the validity of inferring broader communication patterns from a single source. Do members tend to highlight the same or different issues, and attempt to appeal to the same or different audiences across the different communications channels? Does message consistency vary or over time or context such as district competitiveness? Through this work we aim to give an empirical grounding to the implied notion that studying one communication channel is a proxy for studying all communication channels.</a><br><br>
