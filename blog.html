<p><a class="bold"> How to measure party loyalty: Roll Call Votes vs Communication Strategies</a></p>

<p> <a class="body"> In the project that I am working right now, I am interested in explaining why some members of Congress engage in promoting the party's message when some other do not. Recent theories of congressional organization point out that voters rely heavily in the so called Party Brand when deciding their vote. Because it is crucial for members of Congress to be in the majority if they want to have some policy influence, these theories suggest that all members share the interest of promoting the party's communication strategy or Party Brand.</p>

<p> <a class="body"> On the contrary of what these theories suggest, in the paper that I presented at the Western Political Science Association 2014 meeting in Seattle and at the Midwest Political Science Association meeting in Chicago, I argue that members representing very competitive electoral districts and that have no leadership responsibilities are less likely to support the party brand. A clear implication of this paper is that there may be different way of measuring party loyalty. On one hand, roll call votes. Political scientists have been using the different types of Poole and Rosenthal's NOMINATE scores as a proxy of a member ideology and party loyalty. However, by only looking at whether a member votes with the majority of the party or not we are missing part of the story. When voting, members are choosing between a small range of policy options set by the parties' leadership. On the other hand, we can also use what members say in their communication messages to see whether they align with their party or not. In this later case, members are "free" to chose between a full range of options and they can decide wether to make statements supporting the party's message (position-taking) or focusing on issues more closely related to their constituency (credit-claiming or advertising).</p>

<p> <a class="body"> Today I would like to present an example that perfectly illustrates this. In the figure below, there is a density graph that shows the distribution of DW-NOMINATE scores for both parties in Congress. The two vertical lines indicate the mean ideology score for each party. I would like you to take a close look to the two members that I highlight in the graphic: Gary Miller and Bill Flores. They are both republicans with a similar ideology score (around .65), which is above the Republican median. Thus, they both seem to be good party soldiers.</p>

<img src="nominate_example.jpeg">

<p> <a class="body"> However, Gary and Bill represent completely different districts. Gary was elected in the California 31 district: a traditional democrat district that is electorally competitive. Obama won the 2012 presidential elections with a 57.2% vote share (a positive 5.7% difference compared to his 51.5% national share) and Gary won his 2012 General election by only 5 points (45-55%). On the other hand, Bill comes from a very Republican district, what we can consider a safe electoral district. Obama only got there a 45% share in 2012 and Bill won his 2012 election by a huge difference (20-80%).</p>

<img src="miller_flores.jpeg">

<p> As a result, although as the voting records show that Gary supports the party when it comes to vote, he does not want to get involve in supporting the Party Brand and he does not want to present himself as a party soldier but as a moderate representative principally concerned about the problems of his constituency. The following tweets are some examples of the messages that both members sent during the 2013 Government shutdown. As you can see, Bill Flores was very involved in the political dispute between parties at the national level but Gary Miller focused on credit-claiming and advertising. Moreover, the hashtags that Bill Flores used in his tweets were hashtags that were created and promoted by the Republican leadership.</p>

<p><a class="bold"> Partisan Messaging in Congress</a></p>

<p> <a class="body"> Most scholars studing Congress use roll call votes (DW-NOMINATE scores) as a proxy of legislators' ideology. According to this measure, members of the same political party in Congress are ideologically very homogeneous. Some theories argue that, because  the party brand or party ID is what influences the voters the most, all members of Congress share an interest in supporting such party brand. However, I find this quite puzzling. I believe that members from very competitive electoral districts may be interested in not presenting themsevles as party soldiers but as moderate representatives in order to increase their chances of reelection by gaining support of some of the other party's partisans.</a></p>

<p> <a class="body">This weekend I have presented at the MPSA meeting in Chicago a working paper in collaboration with</a> <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/jwilker/Bio.pdf">John Wilkerson</a><a class="body"> and</a> <a href="http://staff.washington.edu/stramp">Nick Stramp</a><a class="body"> in which we illustrate that, although all members of Congress were very active in Twitter during the 2013 Government Shutdown, only some of them participated in partisan messaging. Actually, legislators from very competitive electroal districts were less likely to help the leadership of their parties in spreading the Twitter hashtags that they created to support the party brand</a></p>

<p> <a class="body">If you want to learn more about the study, you can take a look to the</a> <a href="Casas_Wilk_Stramp_MPSA_2014.pdf">draft</a><a class="body"> that we presented in Chicago this weekend.</a></p>
