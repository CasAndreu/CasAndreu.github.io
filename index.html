	  					<b> Abstract:</b> Strong party brands help congressional parties elect candidates, maintain or gain majority control, and advance their policy agendas. Because successful branding efforts depend on consistent messaging, party leaders try to choose issues that most members are willing to promote. But what do leaders do when a party majority pressures them to take up issues that harm the brand for others? We investigate the 2013 government shutdown as a branding event. House Republican leaders instigated the shutdown after learning that a majority of Republicans would not vote for a clean funding bill. However, instead of highlighting the issues that led to the shutdown, they publicized the party's efforts to resolve it. Party leaders sought to exploit the fact that party brands have both position and valence components to simultaneously address the demands of the party base and the electoral concerns of members representing competitive districts.

	  					<b> Abstract:</b> Text has always been an important data source in political science. What has changed in recent years is the feasibility of investigating large amounts of text quantitatively. The internet provides political scientists with more data than their mentors could have imagined, and the research community is providing accessible text analysis software packages, along with training and support. As a result, text as data research is beginning to mainstream in political science. Scholars are tapping new data sources, they are employing more diverse methods, and they are becoming critical consumers of findings based on those methods. In this article, we first introduce readers to the subject by describing the four stages of a typical text as data project. We then review recent political science applications, and explore one important methodological challenge  - topic model instability - in greater detail.

	  					<b> Abstract:</b> In May 2011, thousands of outraged citizens (i.e. the indignados) occupied the squares of the main Spanish cities to express their discontent and claim for reforms. This article investigates via Twitter messages the ability of the 15-M movement to place their claims into the media agenda and to keep ownership of their own discourse. The analysis emphasizes the fact that the social movement originated in the Internet with a highly decentralized structure and with scarce organizational resources. Results show that protesters discourse included a great number of claims, although the activists focused their discussions on three specific issues: electoral and party systems, democracy and governance, and finally, civil liberties. Moreover, the study reveals that the indignados managed to keep control over their repertoires and were able to determine the media agenda despite the later mainly focused on the most dramatic events.

							Images that Matter: Online Protests and the Mobilizing Role of Pictures

							<p class="text-justify"> <b> Abstract </b> <br>
						 Do images affect political mobilization? If so, how? These questions are of fundamental importance to scholars of social movements, contentious politics, and political behavior generally. However, little prior work has systematically addressed the role of images in mobilizing participation in social movements. We theorize that images are more easily processed than text, lowering the cost of deciding to participate in a social movement. In addition, images might trigger emotional responses, increase expectations of success, and generate collective identity; all leading to greater mobilization. We test these theories though a study of Black Lives Matter, utilizing both observational and experimental data. We find that both images in general and the proposed key attributes of images contribute to online participation. Our paper thus provides evidence supporting the broad argument that images increase the likelihood of a protest to spread while also teasing out the mechanisms at play in a new media environment.

							More Effective Than We Thought: Accounting for Legislative Hitchhikers Reveals a More Inclusive and Productive Lawmaking Process

						</h4>

						<p class="text-justify"> <b> Abstract </b> <br>
						 For more than half a century, scholars have been studying legislative effectiveness using a single metric - whether the bills a member sponsors progress through the legislative process. We investigate a less orthodox form of effectiveness - bill proposals that become law as provisions of other bills. Counting these “hitchhiker” bills as additional cases of bill sponsorship success reveals a more productive, less hierarchical and less partisan lawmaking process. We argue that agenda and procedural constraints are central to understanding why lawmakers pursue hitchhiker strategies. We also investigate the legislative vehicles that attract hitchhikers and find, among other things, that more Senate bills are enacted as hitchhikers on House laws than become law on their own.

						</h4> 

						<p class="text-justify"> <b> Abstract </b> <br>
							Social scientists have long argued that images play a crucial role in politics. This role is heightened by the bombardment of images that people experience today. Digitization has both increased the presence of images in daily life and made it easier for scholars to access and collect large quantities of pictures and videos. However, using images as data for social science inference is an arduous task. Political scientists have therefore often turned to other data sources and puzzles, leaving substantive theoretical questions unanswered. Fortunately, recent innovations in computer vision can reduce the costs of using images as data. The goals of this project are twofold. First, we build on existing computer vision methods to present a set of automatic techniques that will aid political scientists working with images. We highlight the potential of Convolutional Neural Nets for automatic object detection and recognition; for face detection and recognition; and for visual sentiment analysis. Second, we apply these techniques to a novel dataset of Black Lives Matter Twitter protest images, demonstrating the ability of computer vision methods to replicate gold standard manual image labels.

							Different Channel, Same Strategy? Filling Empirical Gaps in Congress Literature

	  						<br> <a href="casas_morar_APSA15.pdf" target="_blank"> APSA 2015 Draft </a> 
	  						</small>
						</h4> 

						<p class="text-justify"> <b> Abstract </b> <br>
							Political scientists frequently study the public communications of members of Congress to better understand their electoral strategies, policy responsiveness, ability to influence public opinion and media coverage of Congress. However, different studies base their conclusions on different communication channels, including (among others) member websites, newsletters, press releases, and social media. All these scholars have taken these individual sources as fully representative of the communication strategy of the elected official as a whole. However, what has not been asked is whether members communicate the same or different messages across these differing channels? In this paper we look at the member press releases, Twitter, and Facebook messages sent from August to December 2014 in order to study to what extent their communication strategy is consistent across channels. We use an automatic semi-supervised method to classify the messages into political issues and to assess the validity of inferring broader communication patterns from a single source.
