	  					<b> Abstract:</b> In May 2011, thousands of outraged citizens (i.e. the indignados) occupied the squares of the main Spanish cities to express their discontent and claim for reforms. This article investigates via Twitter messages the ability of the 15-M movement to place their claims into the media agenda and to keep ownership of their own discourse. The analysis emphasizes the fact that the social movement originated in the Internet with a highly decentralized structure and with scarce organizational resources. Results show that protesters discourse included a great number of claims, although the activists focused their discussions on three specific issues: electoral and party systems, democracy and governance, and finally, civil liberties. Moreover, the study reveals that the indignados managed to keep control over their repertoires and were able to determine the media agenda despite the later mainly focused on the most dramatic events.

							A Delicate Balance: Policy Position and Legislative Performance Branding during the 2013 Government Shutdown

						<p class="text-justify"> <b> Abstract </b> <br>
						 A large research literature portrays party labels as marketing brands that serve as efficient sources of information about a party's candidates. Parties build strong brands by sending clear and consistent signals to voters. But how do party leaders promote strong brands that benefit all party members? The answer is not always obvious. In 2013, House Republican leaders initiated a partial government shutdown under pressure from conservatives, even as others in the caucus warned that it might cause Republicans to lose the House. We find that, after initiating the shutdown, party leaders engaged in a public messaging effort that downplayed the divisive issues leading to the shutdown (position branding) and emphasized the party's progress in resolving it (legislative performance branding). These findings provide insights into how party leaders seek to address internal branding conflicts, and may help to explain why the shutdown did not end up being the electoral disaster many predicted.

							Images that Matter: Online Protests and the Mobilizing Role of Pictures

						</h4>

							<p class="text-justify"> <b> Abstract </b> <br>
						 Do images affect political mobilization? If so, how? These questions are of fundamental importance to scholars of social movements, contentious politics, and political behavior generally. However, little prior work has systematically addressed the role of images in mobilizing participation in social movements. We theorize that images are more easily processed than text, lowering the cost of deciding to participate in a social movement. In addition, images might trigger emotional responses, increase expectations of success, and generate collective identity; all leading to greater mobilization. We test these theories though a study of Black Lives Matter, utilizing both observational and experimental data. We find that both images in general and the proposed key attributes of images contribute to online participation. Our paper thus provides evidence supporting the broad argument that images increase the likelihood of a protest to spread while also teasing out the mechanisms at play in a new media environment.

							Different Channel, Same Strategy? Filling Empirical Gaps in Congress Literature

	  						<br> <a href="casas_morar_APSA15.pdf" target="_blank"> APSA 2015 Draft </a>

						</h4> 

						<p class="text-justify"> <b> Abstract </b> <br>
							Political scientists frequently study the public communications of members of Congress to better understand their electoral strategies, policy responsiveness, ability to influence public opinion and media coverage of Congress. However, different studies base their conclusions on different communication channels, including (among others) member websites, newsletters, press releases, and social media. All these scholars have taken these individual sources as fully representative of the communication strategy of the elected official as a whole. However, what has not been asked is whether members communicate the same or different messages across these differing channels? In this paper we look at the member press releases, Twitter, and Facebook messages sent from August to December 2014 in order to study to what extent their communication strategy is consistent across channels. We use an automatic semi-supervised method to classify the messages into political issues and to assess the validity of inferring broader communication patterns from a single source.
